## About a guy…

Hi there. This is the first (and maybe last) post I'll write on my website. Don't worry, I’m not crossing any rivers soon—at least, I don't plan to—but I know how erratic my interests can be, so this website might just be another short-lived passion.

The reason I decided to build this website is simple: if you work in the **data field**, you need a place to showcase your work to increase your chances of getting hired. It took me a while to accept this, but here we are[^1].

However, this isn’t the real reason I’m excited about the website. I realized that having a space to share my thoughts and ideas could be an opportunity to do one of the things I love most—learning. A few years ago, I left academia after completing my PhD in neuroscience. I left mainly because the available career options didn’t appeal to me. Ironically, I wanted to keep doing research, but the choices were either highly uncertain jobs that required a lot of mobility or tenure positions, where research time gradually gets traded for administrative and teaching duties. Although I could have delayed making this decision for a few more years, I felt it was better to cut things short and make a change sooner.

I ended up doing something completely different[^2], but part of me still feels empty because I miss the intellectual challenge and stimulation academia offers. I hope this website will be a chance to reconnect with my scientific roots.

## The Neuromancer…why?

Good question! I’m ashamed to admit that I haven’t yet read [Gibson’s novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer). In my defense, the simple (and true) answer is that I just thought the name was cool—or at least more inspiring than *Jacopo Barone*. That said, it’s actually quite fitting given my background and interests.
During my master’s studies, I became fascinated by research that explored using technology to rehabilitate or enhance human motor abilities—essentially combining humans and machines to counter certain disorders and disabilities[^3]. It felt like something straight out of a video game—think *Deus Ex* (or *Cyberpunk 2077* for younger readers). At the time, I dreamed of completing my studies in cognitive neuroscience and then pursuing a degree in engineering or robotics. I envisioned working on ambitious projects where human-machine integration could improve the quality of life for people facing physical challenges.
However, life took a different turn. I followed my partner to the UK, where we now have two kids, and the rest is history. While I’m incredibly grateful for how things turned out, part of me still feels that pull to reignite those old passions.

[^1]: Ironically, I now struggle to showcase a single project, despite having worked as a researcher in academia and then as a data 'scientist' in the public sector for more than six years. This might sound like a dangerous confession on a platform meant to highlight how special and hireable you are, but I’m comforted by the thought that no one will probably ever read this post.
[^2]: And I mean it! I’ve worked as a data analyst/scientist for the UK government, first at the Office for National Statistics and then at the Department for Business and Trade. As you can imagine, neuroscience—or science in general—isn’t really on the menu.
[^3]: The very first studies that introduced me to this world were those from the [Courtine’s lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/courtine-lab/#).
