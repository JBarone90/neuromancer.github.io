## About Me

{{< profile-image src="/images/profile.jpeg" alt="Jacopo Barone"  >}}

Hi,  
my name is Jacopo Barone. I work as an analyst and data scientist for the UK government.

Ages ago, I studied psychology and neuroscience. I completed a PhD on neural oscillations in the motor system using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). I currently reside in Cardiff, Wales, but I am originally Italian. I live here happily with my partner and our two goblins.
